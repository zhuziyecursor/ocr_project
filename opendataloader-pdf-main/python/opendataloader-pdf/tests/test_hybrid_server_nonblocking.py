"""Tests for hybrid_server non-blocking conversion.

Verifies that converter.convert() runs in a thread pool rather than blocking
the event loop. This is the root cause of issue #301: the Java client's
3-second health check times out when the server is busy with a synchronous
conversion call inside an async endpoint.
